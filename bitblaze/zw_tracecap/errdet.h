/* Error detection
 * TEMU has some support for detecting errors in programs
 * The function enable_detection takes as input a mask in which each bit 
 *   represents a different technique being used to detect errors.
 * The following techniques are defined:
 *   1) DETECT_COND_TAINTEIP
 *     Instruction counter (EIP) is tainted
 *     Usually gives too many false positives
 *   2) DETECT_COND_EXCEPTION
 *     Invalid memory access exception (Windows only)
 *   3) DETECT_COND_NULLPTR 
 *     Program is dereferencing a null pointer
 *   4) DETECT_COND_PROCESSEXIT 
 *     Process being traced exits
 *     Useful with programs that should not exit like network servers
 *
 * The default action for all detection methods is to stop the trace and
 *   exit TEMU with a return value specific to the condition that was met
 *
 * Multiple techniques can be used simultaneously by constructing a mask 
 *   that AND's different macros 
 *
 * There is also to macros to activate or deactivate all techniques:
 *   DETECT_COND_NONE, DETECT_COND_ALL
 *
